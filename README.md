# Ecosystem Simulation For Natural Selection
 An ecosystem created to simulate the way in which natural selection reacts to different environments.

This project is still being worked on and updated.
Future Adds:
- Reproduction
- Improved pathfinding AI
- More species
- Remove rare glitch that causes pathifnding to stop working when prey is eaten
